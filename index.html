    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>Hello, I'm David Liu. I am an 11th grader at <a href="https://cc.sduhsd.net/" target="_blank">Canyon Crest Academy</a> in San Diego. I was born in Chandler, Arizona, and lived there until I moved to San Diego in 3rd grade. My favorite subject in school is math because I enjoy solving problems. Outside of school, some hobbies include basketball, chess, scootering, and working out. Some adjectives to describe myself would be smart, lighthearted, and nice. </p>

    <h3>Basketball</h3>
